# -Emotion-Classification-Model
Approach Summary for Emotion Classification
1. Dataset Preparation
The dataset emotion_dataset_raw.csv is loaded using Pandas.

The raw text data is cleaned and processed to ensure compatibility with deep learning models.

NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) is used for stopword removal and stemming (PorterStemmer).

Texts are tokenized using Tokenizer() from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.text.

Labels are encoded using LabelEncoder() from sklearn.preprocessing.

One-hot encoding is applied to transform categorical labels for neural network compatibility.

2. Text Preprocessing & Vectorization
Tokenized sequences are converted into numerical vectors using Keras' Embedding layer.

Sequence padding ensures uniform input length across the dataset (pad_sequences).

The maximum sequence length is determined dynamically based on dataset properties.

3. Model Architecture (Deep Learning)
The emotion classification model follows a sequential LSTM-based architecture, ensuring optimal feature extraction for NLP tasks:

Embedding Layer: Converts tokenized text into dense vector representations.

LSTM Layer: Captures sequential dependencies and patterns in the text input.

Dropout Layer: Helps prevent overfitting (dropout rate: 0.5).

Dense Layer (Hidden): Fully connected layer with ReLU activation (64 neurons).

Dense Output Layer: Multi-class classification using softmax activation.

4. Model Compilation & Training
Optimizer: Adam (efficient weight updates for deep learning).

Loss function: categorical_crossentropy (suitable for multi-class classification).

Batch size: 32, trained for 10 epochs.

Validation split ensures performance tracking during training.

5. Evaluation & Metrics
Model performance is validated using a confusion matrix and accuracy_score.

Predictions are compared against the test set labels using Scikit-learn evaluation functions.

Predictions are further tested on sample text inputs for real-world application validation.

6. Real-time Emotion Classification
User input is tokenized and converted to padded sequences.

The trained model predicts the emotion class.

Labels are decoded back to human-readable emotion categories.
